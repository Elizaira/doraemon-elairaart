### Div and Class
##### `<div>` is a tag section in a document that is styled with CSS. It is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
##### The `class` attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name. Here I create a class head, face, mouth, eyes and nose to identify the parts I add to become Elmo's face. 

### CSS Extension 
##### CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

#### Using CSS

##### CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
* Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
* Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
* External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

##### Here I use external CSS `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/elmo-style.css">` to call the CSS file I created outside the index.html file.

### CSS Border
##### Add `border: 5px solid #0d0d0e;` to your CSS class/id to add border. `5px` is the thickness of the border you want to add. `solid` is a straight line, you can use dotted, dashed and others. `#000`is the color of your border.

### Color
##### `color`and `background-color`are not the same. When you declare it in text, `color` can change the color of the text. `background-color`can use to change the whole color in the page or in the shapes.

### Margin
#### In CSS margins can be use to adjust the position. Declare `margin-right` or `right`, `margin-left` or `left`, `margin-bottom` or `margin-top` to change position.
